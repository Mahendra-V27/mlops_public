# MLOps Public Project

## Overview

This repository contains the codebase for an MLOps pipeline designed to streamline the development, deployment, monitoring, and maintenance of machine learning models. The pipeline supports versioning, automated testing, deployment strategies, and infrastructure-as-code principles.

## Features

- **Model Training**: Automated model training and validation process.
- **Model Versioning**: Manage multiple versions of models, allowing for easy rollbacks and tracking improvements.
- **Deployment**: Supports continuous deployment (CD) pipelines for deploying models to production environments.
- **Monitoring**: Set up for monitoring model performance in real time and ensuring models perform well post-deployment.
- **Logging**: Detailed logs for error tracking and performance analysis.
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Using tools like Terraform/CloudFormation to manage the deployment infrastructure.
- **CI/CD Integration**: Seamless integration with GitHub Actions/Jenkins for CI/CD.


## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/username/mlops_public.git
    cd mlops_public
    ```

2. Set up a virtual environment and install dependencies:

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## CI/CD

This repository uses GitHub Actions for CI/CD pipelines. Whenever a new model is pushed to the `main` branch, the following steps are automatically triggered:
- Code linting
- Unit and integration tests
- Model training
- Model deployment
